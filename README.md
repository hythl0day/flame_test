A weird bug on Flame/Flutter:

The fps will drop to 55 or so. And will drop to 45 if I move the window. But it should never happen consider there is only one static picture is rendering. And the FPS will be 60 full when I am moving mouse cursor quickly.

This should never happen consider this is a barebone project with only on static picture for rendering.
